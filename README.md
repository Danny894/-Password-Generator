## 🧩 How It Works
The script uses Python’s built-in `random` and `string` libraries to create a secure password by randomly selecting characters from:
- Uppercase letters (A-Z)
- Lowercase letters (a-z)
- Digits (0-9)
- Special characters (!@#$%^&*)

## ✨ Future Improvements
- Option to exclude special characters.
- GUI version using Tkinter or PyQt.
- Ability to generate multiple passwords at once.
- Save generated passwords to a file.
